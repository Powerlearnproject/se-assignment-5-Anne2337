9. Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
Using Source Control:
Example: Debugging a Simple Node.js Program
1.Install Node.js:
Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from nodejs.org.
2.Install VS Code and Extensions:
Install Visual Studio Code.
Install the JavaScript Debugger extension (built-in for JavaScript and Node.js).
3.Create a Simple Node.js Program:
Open VS Code and create a new folder for your project.
4.Open the Project in VS Code:
Open the project folder in VS Code by going to File > Open Folder... and selecting the folder.
5. Set Up a Debug Configuration:
Open the Debug view by clicking the Debug icon in the Activity Bar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+D.
Click the gear icon to open launch.json. If it doesn't exist, VS Code will prompt you to create it.

Steps to Set Up and Start Debugging a Simple Program in VS Code
Example: Debugging a Simple Node.js Program
Install Node.js:

Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from nodejs.org.
Install VS Code and Extensions:

Install Visual Studio Code.
Install the JavaScript Debugger extension (built-in for JavaScript and Node.js).
Create a Simple Node.js Program:

Open VS Code and create a new folder for your project.
In the folder, create a file named app.js with the following content:
javascript
Copy code
console.log('Hello, world!');
let count = 0;
function increment() {
    count++;
    console.log(`Count is now: ${count}`);
}
increment();
increment();
increment();
Open the Project in VS Code:

Open the project folder in VS Code by going to File > Open Folder... and selecting the folder.
Set Up a Debug Configuration:

Open the Debug view by clicking the Debug icon in the Activity Bar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+D.
Click the gear icon to open launch.json. If it doesn't exist, VS Code will prompt you to create it.
Select Node.js as the environment. This will create a launch.json file with a default configuration:
json
Copy code
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Program",
            "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"],
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
        }
    ]
}
6.Set Breakpoints:
Open app.js and click in the gutter next to the line numbers to set breakpoints where you want the debugger to pause. For example, set a breakpoint on the line count++;.
7. Start Debugging:
In the Debug view, click the green play button or press F5 to start debugging.
The debugger will start, and the program will run until it hits a breakpoint.
8. Use Debug Controls:
Continue / Pause (F5): Continue running the program or pause it at the current execution point.
Step Over (F10): Move to the next line of code, skipping over function calls.
Step Into (F11): Move into the next function call.
Step Out (Shift+F11): Move out of the current function and back to the caller.
Restart (Ctrl+Shift+F5): Restart the debug session.
Stop (Shift+F5): End the debug session.
9. Inspect Variables:
Use the Variables pane in the Debug view to inspect the current state of local and global variables.
10.Evaluate Expressions:
Use the Debug Console to evaluate expressions, inspect variables, and execute code snippets while debugging.
11.Monitor Expressions:
Add expressions to the Watch pane to monitor their values as you step through the code.
12.View Call Stack:
Use the Call Stack pane to view the stack trace and understand the sequence of function calls.
Key Debugging Features in VS Code
1. Breakpoints:
Set breakpoints to pause execution at specific lines.
Conditional Breakpoints: Break only when a specified condition is met.
Logpoints: Log a message to the console without stopping execution.
2. Step Controls:
Step Over: Execute the next line of code, but donâ€™t step into functions.
Step Into: Step into the next function call.
Step Out: Step out of the current function.
Restart: Restart the current debug session.
Stop: Stop the debug session.
3. Variable Inspection:
Inspect variables, their values, and their types in the Variables pane.
4. Watch Expressions:
Monitor the value of specific expressions in the Watch pane.
5. Call Stack:
View the call stack to understand the execution path and trace function calls.
6. Debug Console:
Evaluate expressions, execute commands, and interact with the runtime environment.
Using Source Control in VS Code
VS Code has built-in support for Git, allowing you to manage source control directly from the editor.
Setting Up Source Control
1. Initialize a Repository:
Open your project folder in VS Code.
Open the Source Control view by clicking the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+G.
