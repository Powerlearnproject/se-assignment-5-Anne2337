Steps to Set Up and Start Debugging a Simple Program in VS Code
Example: Debugging a Simple Node.js Program
Install Node.js:

Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from nodejs.org.
Install VS Code and Extensions:

Install Visual Studio Code.
Install the JavaScript Debugger extension (built-in for JavaScript and Node.js).
Create a Simple Node.js Program:

Open VS Code and create a new folder for your project.
In the folder, create a file named app.js with the following content:
javascript
Copy code
console.log('Hello, world!');
let count = 0;
function increment() {
    count++;
    console.log(`Count is now: ${count}`);
}
increment();
increment();
increment();
Open the Project in VS Code:

Open the project folder in VS Code by going to File > Open Folder... and selecting the folder.
Set Up a Debug Configuration:

Open the Debug view by clicking the Debug icon in the Activity Bar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+D.
Click the gear icon to open launch.json. If it doesn't exist, VS Code will prompt you to create it.
Select Node.js as the environment. This will create a launch.json file with a default configuration:
json
Copy code
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Program",
            "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"],
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
        }
    ]
}
6.Set Breakpoints:
Open app.js and click in the gutter next to the line numbers to set breakpoints where you want the debugger to pause. For example, set a breakpoint on the line count++;.
7. Start Debugging:
In the Debug view, click the green play button or press F5 to start debugging.
The debugger will start, and the program will run until it hits a breakpoint.
8. Use Debug Controls:
Continue / Pause (F5): Continue running the program or pause it at the current execution point.
Step Over (F10): Move to the next line of code, skipping over function calls.
Step Into (F11): Move into the next function call.
Step Out (Shift+F11): Move out of the current function and back to the caller.
Restart (Ctrl+Shift+F5): Restart the debug session.
Stop (Shift+F5): End the debug session.
9. Inspect Variables:
Use the Variables pane in the Debug view to inspect the current state of local and global variables.
10.Evaluate Expressions:
Use the Debug Console to evaluate expressions, inspect variables, and execute code snippets while debugging.
11.Monitor Expressions:
Add expressions to the Watch pane to monitor their values as you step through the code.
12.View Call Stack:
Use the Call Stack pane to view the stack trace and understand the sequence of function calls.
Key Debugging Features in VS Code
1. Breakpoints:
Set breakpoints to pause execution at specific lines.
Conditional Breakpoints: Break only when a specified condition is met.
Logpoints: Log a message to the console without stopping execution.
2. Step Controls:
Step Over: Execute the next line of code, but don’t step into functions.
Step Into: Step into the next function call.
Step Out: Step out of the current function.
Restart: Restart the current debug session.
Stop: Stop the debug session.
3. Variable Inspection:
Inspect variables, their values, and their types in the Variables pane.
4. Watch Expressions:
Monitor the value of specific expressions in the Watch pane.
5. Call Stack:
View the call stack to understand the execution path and trace function calls.
6. Debug Console:
Evaluate expressions, execute commands, and interact with the runtime environment.
Using Source Control in VS Code
VS Code has built-in support for Git, allowing you to manage source control directly from the editor.
Setting Up Source Control
1. Initialize a Repository:
Open your project folder in VS Code.
Open the Source Control view by clicking the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+G.
Click Initialize Repository if your project isn't already a Git repository.
2. Cloning a Repository:
Open the Command Palette with Ctrl+Shift+P.
Type Git: Clone and enter the repository URL.
Select the local folder where you want to clone the repository.
Basic Source Control Operations
1. Staging Changes:
Open the Source Control view.
Files with changes will be listed under Changes.
Hover over a file and click the + icon to stage it, or click the + icon next to Changes to stage all changes.
2. Committing Changes:
In the Source Control view, enter a commit message in the message box.
Click the checkmark icon to commit the staged changes.
3. Syncing Changes:
Click the ellipsis (...) in the Source Control view.
Select Push to push your changes to the remote repository.
Select Pull to pull changes from the remote repository.
Advanced Source Control Operations
1. Branching and Merging:
Click the branch icon in the bottom left of the status bar.
Select Create Branch to create a new branch.
Select Checkout to... to switch branches.
Use the Source Control view to merge branches by selecting Merge Branch....
2.Viewing History and Diffs:
Right-click a file in the Source Control view and select View File History to see the commit history.
Right-click a file and select Compare with Previous to see the differences between versions.
3.Using Source Control Extensions:
Install extensions like GitLens to enhance Git capabilities with features like blame annotations, commit history, and more.

10. How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
Submission Guidelines:
Prerequisites
1.Install Git:
Download and install Git from git-scm.com.
Ensure Git is installed and configured properly. You can check by running git --version in your terminal.
2.Install VS Code:
Ensure you have Visual Studio Code installed.
3. Set Up a GitHub Account:
Create a GitHub account at github.com if you don't already have one.
Step-by-Step Process
1. Initialize a Git Repository
Open Your Project in VS Code:
Open VS Code and open your project folder by going to File > Open Folder....
Initialize Git Repository:
Open the Source Control view by clicking the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+G.
Click the Initialize Repository button to initialize a Git repository in your project folder.
This will create a .git folder in your project directory, making it a Git repository.
2. Making Commits
1. Stage Changes:
Any changes to your files will be listed under the Changes section in the Source Control view.
To stage changes, hover over a file and click the + icon or click the + icon next to Changes to stage all changes.
2.Commit Changes:
In the message box above the staged changes, enter a commit message describing your changes.
Click the checkmark icon to commit the staged changes.
3. View File Changes:
Click on a file in the Changes section to view the differences between the working directory and the last commit.
3. Pushing Changes to GitHub
1.Create a Repository on GitHub:
Go to GitHub and log in.
Click the + icon in the top right and select New repository.
Enter a name for your repository, add a description if desired, and click Create repository.
2.Add Remote Repository:
In VS Code, open the terminal by pressing Ctrl+ or going to View > Terminal.
Add the GitHub repository as a remote by running:
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Replace your-username with your GitHub username and your-repo with the repository name.
3.Push Changes:
To push your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub, run:
git push -u origin master
If prompted, enter your GitHub username and password (or use a personal access token for enhanced security).
4. Subsequent Commits and Pushes
1.Stage and Commit Changes:
Make further changes to your files.
Stage and commit the changes as described above.
2. Push Changes:
Push the committed changes to GitHub by clicking the ... icon in the Source Control view and selecting Push or by running:
git push
Submission Guidelines
When submitting your work using Git and GitHub, follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth process:
1. Include a README:
Add a README.md file to your repository with an overview of the project, setup instructions, and any other relevant information.
2. Write Descriptive Commit Messages:
Ensure your commit messages are clear and descriptive, explaining the purpose of the changes.
3.Organize Your Repository:
Structure your project files logically. Use directories to organize code, assets, and documentation.
4.Use Branches for Features/Improvements:
Create separate branches for different features or improvements. Merge them into the main branch after review.
5.Ensure Code Quality:
Follow coding standards and practices. Use linters and formatters to maintain code quality.
6.Document Your Code:
Add comments and documentation to your code to make it easier to understand and maintain.
7. Provide Example Data:
